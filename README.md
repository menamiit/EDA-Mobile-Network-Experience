# EDA-Project  
Exploratory Data Analysis on the Mobile Network Experience dataset.
First, we combined 4 different datasets to finally achieve desirable dataset to work on.
While exploring the dataset, we uncovered several patterns and insights related to user ratings, call drop issues, and network performance. We used clear visualizations to highlight important trends and relationships. Finally, we built a simple linear regression model to predict user ratings based on location data.
